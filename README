A stemming algorithm based on Porter's Stemmer - http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/def.txt.

In the demo, input a word, and it will output the stem of that word.

Example:

Connected, connecting, connection -> connect

The Stemmer.js object will output an array of strings of length 8. Each of the strings in the array corresponds to a step in the algorithm's definition. The last string is the stemmed word.
